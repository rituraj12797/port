I am a pre-final year student at IIIT Gwalior with a strong interest in how high-quality software is designed and built. I enjoy reading technical blogs, exploring large-scale system architectures, and implementing optimizations and MVPs that power real-world software.

Acquiring knowledge on scalable and high performant systems is something I really love, thats' why most of my time these days are around reading useful techincal blogs, enhancing my knowledge of how fundamentals are used to create high impact softwares and sharing my understanding on them.
