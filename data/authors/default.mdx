I am a pre-final year student at IIIT Gwalior with a strong interest in how high-quality software is designed and built. I enjoy reading technical blogs, exploring large-scale system architectures, and implementing optimizations and MVPs that power real-world software.

My primary areas of focus are system architecture, low-latency software, databases, OS internals and core backend systems. I study systems engineering and optimization algorithms to design scalable, reliable, and performant systems. In development, I currently concentrate on backend and systems programming and am comfortable with Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, C/C++, and C#; 

Competitive programming is another passion. I actively solve algorithmic problems and have the following ratings and results:
- Codeforces: Specialist (1550)
- CodeChef: 4â˜…
- AtCoder: 6 kyu
- IICPC Prelims 2025: Top ~1.8k out of 50k+ participants
- Meta Hacker Cup 2025: advanced to Round 2 (ranked ~3.6k in Round 1)

Here i write about my learnings in form of techical blogs with an emphasis on systems design, performance engineering, and practical implementation details that help bridge theory and production-grade software.

Acquiring knowledge on scalable and high performant systems is something I really love, thats' why most of my time these days are around reading useful techincal blogs, enhancing my knowledge of how fundamentals are used to high impact softwares and sharing my understanding on them.
